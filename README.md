# MachEightCodingChallenge
This is my solution for Mach Eight's Coding Challenge

To execute this application you must have python 3.7.x and install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

The main.py file contains the main function of the app, so you only need to execute that file to start the application.

<code>python main.py</code>

The application will show you the instructions.

Besides, in the project folder you could see a folder call test, it contains the unit test for Client and Matcher class.
You should use an IDE like PyCharm to run those tests.
